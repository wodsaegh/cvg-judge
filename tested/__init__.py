"""
The TESTed package is a universal judge for the Dodona platform.
More information can be found in the thesis manuscript.

If you are interested in running TESTed, you can:

1. Use this package as an executable module (python -m tested). This will use the
   command line interface, which is also available to Dodona.
2. Run it programmatically, by running the manual module (python -m tested.manual).
   This should allow easier usage and illustrates programmatic use.
