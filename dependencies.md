# Dependencies for TESTed

This file contains an overview of the various dependencies used by TESTed, and which versions are known to work. For
each language, we list the required dependencies, and their install instructions.

## I just want a Docker file

See https://github.com/dodona-edu/docker-images/blob/master/dodona-tested.dockerfile

You can also take a look at the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file, as it will also install most dependencies.

Therefore, the core Python dependencies are not optional.

```shell

# Only needed if you want to run tests
$ pip install -r requirements-tests.txt
```
